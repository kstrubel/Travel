<h1>{{ country_code }} - France</h1>
<p>
    January 2018.<br><br>
    We flew into Paris from Morocco.  We were incredibly excited to eat food our stomachs were more accustomed too. I had
    eaten some pretty sketchy meals in Morocco and was excited to stuff my face with crepes and croissants.  Surprisingly,
    the highest rated restaurants in the area we were staying were all asian restaurants.  My favorite was Kintaro.  The line
    was always down the block.  The Paris brasseries always had cool atmosphere to sit outside at night, sipping cognac.<br><br>
    I think we walked the entire city.<br><br>
